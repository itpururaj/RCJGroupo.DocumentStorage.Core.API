# RCJGroupo.DocumentStorage.Core.API

.Net Core Web API demo to store and download PDF file in SQL database.

This project is created to demo capability to create solution structure, Unit test, and Specflow Integration test (just featue and steps as time was just an hour).

We can create Web API Client (added in solution strucute), so that we can consume that in Integration Test or any other application.
